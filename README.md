My business card to code in svg

## How to
Use any modern browser to open index.html or business_card.svg
```
google-chrome business_card.svg

or

google-chrome index.html
```
Note: Your browser need to be modern enough to support HTML5 ...
like newest google chrome will just work fine

Also note:
just tried on github that the svg will not be correctly rendered (extern image links dead)
So I ll try put on my server and release a link soon

## The project
Only for myself to learn svg and try filters around
